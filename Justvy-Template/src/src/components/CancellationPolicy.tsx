        <p>
          At Justvy Global Innovations LLP, we place a high value on our clients' trust and satisfaction. While we work diligently to 
          deliver exceptional IT products and services, we understand that there may be situations where a client needs to cancel a 
          service. This Cancellation Policy is designed to outline the conditions under which services can be canceled, the process for 
          requesting a cancellation, and any fees that may apply.
        </p>

        <h1 className="font-bold text-4xl py-3">Eligibility for Cancellation</h1>
        <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl">Overview</h3>
        <p>
          The decision to cancel a service is one that should be made with careful consideration. At Justvy Global Innovations LLP, we recognize 
          that certain circumstances may necessitate the cancellation of a service. This section outlines the specific conditions under which a 
          cancellation request will be considered valid.
        </p>
        <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl">Service Has Not Yet Commenced</h3>
        <p>
          Cancellations are most straightforward when the service has not yet commenced and no work has been started. In such cases, clients 
          are generally eligible for a full refund, as no resources have been allocated or expenses incurred. This applies to both project-based 
          and subscription-based services.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, if a client signs a contract for a custom software development project but later decides to cancel before the 
          initial planning or design phase begins, they may request a cancellation without incurring any fees. However, the request must 
          be made before any work is initiated.
        </p>
        <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl">Early-Stage Projects</h3>
        <p>
          If the project is still in its early stages, and deliverables have not yet been finalized or delivered, a cancellation may be requested. 
          Early-stage projects typically include preliminary activities such as project scoping, initial design drafts, and basic setup tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          In these cases, while a cancellation is possible, there may be associated fees to cover the work already completed. This ensures 
          that Justvy Global Innovations LLP is fairly compensated for the time and resources invested in the project up to that point.
        </p>
        <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl">Subscription-Based Services</h3>
        <p>
          For subscription-based services, cancellations can be made at any time, but must be requested before the next billing cycle begins. 
          This allows clients to avoid being charged for the upcoming billing period. It is important to note that once a billing cycle has 
          started, the service will continue until the end of that period, and no partial refunds will be issued.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if a client is subscribed to a monthly cloud hosting service and wishes to cancel, they must do so before the start of 
          the next month to avoid being billed. If the cancellation request is made mid-month, the service will remain active until the end of 
          the current billing cycle.
        </p>

        <h1 className="font-bold text-4xl py-3">How to Request a Cancellation</h1>
        <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl">Initiating the Cancellation Process</h3>
        <p>
          To ensure that cancellations are handled efficiently, clients must follow a formal process when requesting to cancel a service. 
          This process is designed to gather all necessary information and ensure that both parties are on the same page regarding the cancellation.
        </p>
        <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl">Contacting Support</h3>
        <p>
          To request a cancellation, clients should contact our support team at <a href="mailto:info@Justvy.in" className="text-blue-600">info@Justvy.in </a> 
          or through their account dashboard, if applicable. The support team is available to assist with the cancellation process and answer any questions clients may have.
        </p>
        <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl">Required Information</h3>
        <p>
        When submitting a cancellation request, clients must include the following details to facilitate the process:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
        <li>
            <strong>Order or Project Reference Number:</strong> This unique identifier helps our team quickly locate 
            the specific service or project in question, ensuring that the correct account is updated.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Reason for Cancellation:</strong> A clear explanation of why the client wishes to cancel the 
            service. While clients are not obligated to provide a detailed justification, understanding the reason 
            for cancellation helps us improve our services and address any underlying issues.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Relevant Documentation or Communication:</strong> Any supporting documents or previous correspondence 
            related to the service or project can be helpful in processing the cancellation request. This might include 
            emails, contracts, or records of any issues that led to the decision to cancel.
        </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl">Acknowledgment of Request</h3>
        <p>
          For project-based services, the cancellation fee structure is designed to fairly compensate Justvy Global 
          Innovations LLP for work already completed, while also taking into account the stage of the project at the 
          time of cancellation.
        </p>

        <h1 className="font-bold text-4xl py-3">Cancellation Fees</h1>
        <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl">Project-Based Services</h3>
        <p>
          For project-based services, the cancellation fee structure is designed to fairly compensate Justvy Global 
          Innovations LLP for work already completed, while also taking into account the stage of the project at the 
          time of cancellation.
        </p>
        <h4 className='font-bold text-lg'>Early-Stage Cancellations</h4>
        <p>
          If a project has started but is still in its early stages, a cancellation fee of 25% of the total project cost 
          will be charged. This fee covers the initial work done, including planning, design, and any setup activities 
          that have already been completed.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if a client cancels a custom software development project shortly after it has begun, the 25% fee 
          will help cover the costs of any initial meetings, documentation, and design work that was done before the 
          cancellation request was made.
        </p>
        <h4 className='font-bold text-lg'>Near-Completion Cancellations</h4>
        <p>
          If the project is near completion (more than 75% completed), the full project cost may be charged, and no refunds 
          will be issued. This policy reflects the fact that most of the work has already been done, and canceling at this 
          stage would result in significant losses for Justvy Global Innovations LLP.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, if a client cancels a website development project when the site is nearly ready for launch, the client 
          may be required to pay the remaining balance, as the majority of the work has been completed.
        </p>
        <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl">Subscription-Based Services</h3>
        <p>
          The cancellation fees for subscription-based services are structured to ensure that clients are billed fairly based on 
          the timing of their cancellation request.
        </p>
        <h4 className='font-bold text-lg'>Mid-Cycle Cancellations</h4>
        <p>
          If a cancellation is requested after the billing cycle has started, the service will continue until the end of the current 
          billing period, and no partial refunds will be issued. Clients are encouraged to plan their cancellations accordingly to 
          avoid being billed for an additional period they do not intend to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if a client subscribes to a quarterly data analytics service and cancels halfway through the quarter, the 
          service will remain active until the end of the quarter, but no refund will be given for the unused portion of the service.
        </p>
        <h4 className='font-bold text-lg'>Pre-Cycle Cancellations</h4>
        <p>
          If a cancellation is requested before the billing cycle begins, no charges will be applied for the upcoming period. This 
          allows clients to avoid incurring additional costs for services they no longer wish to use.
        </p>

        <h1 className="font-bold text-4xl py-3">Impact of Cancellation</h1>
        <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl">Termination of Access</h3>
        <p>
          Upon cancellation of services, access to all related services, accounts, and data provided by Justvy Global 
          Innovations LLP will be terminated. Clients should ensure that they have backed up any necessary data or 
          information before requesting a cancellation, as access cannot be restored once the service is canceled.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if a client cancels a cloud storage service, they should download all important files before 
          the service is terminated to avoid losing any data.
        </p>
        <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl">Cessation of Support and Maintenance</h3>
        <p>
          Any ongoing support or maintenance services will cease immediately upon cancellation. This means that clients 
          will no longer have access to technical support, updates, or any other maintenance services provided as part 
          of their agreement with Justvy Global Innovations LLP.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, if a client cancels a software maintenance contract, they will no longer receive updates or 
          bug fixes for the software, and any support requests will not be handled by our team.
        </p>

        <h1 className="font-bold text-4xl py-3">Exceptions</h1>
        <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl">Custom Software Solutions</h3>
        <p>
          Custom software solutions or specialized services may have unique cancellation terms, as specified in the 
          contract or service agreement. These terms are tailored to the specific nature of the project and the resources 
          required to deliver the solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, a bespoke software solution that requires significant customization may have stricter cancellation 
          terms due to the complexity and resource investment involved.
        </p>
        <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl">Force Majeure</h3>
        <p>
          In cases of force majeure or other extraordinary circumstances, cancellation terms may be adjusted at the 
          discretion of Justvy Global Innovations LLP. Force majeure events include natural disasters, pandemics, war, 
          or other unforeseeable events that prevent either party from fulfilling their contractual obligations.
        </p>
        <p>
         In such cases, Justvy Global Innovations LLP will work with the client to determine a fair and reasonable course 
         of action, which may include waiving cancellation fees or extending deadlines.
        </p>

        <h1 className="font-bold text-4xl py-3">Non-Cancellable Items</h1>
        <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl">Fully Delivered Services</h3>
        <p>
          The following items are non-cancellable:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
            <li>
              <strong>Services or Products that Have Been Fully Delivered and Accepted by the Customer: </strong>
               Once a service or product has been fully delivered and accepted, it is considered complete, and no 
               cancellations or refunds will be issued. Acceptance is typically documented through written confirmation, 
               approval of deliverables, or any other form of acknowledgment from the client.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For example, if a client has signed off on the final version of a mobile app developed by Justvy Global Innovations 
          LLP, the service is considered fully delivered, and no cancellations will be allowed.
        </p>
        <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl">Third-Party Purchases</h3>
        <p>
          Third-party software, licenses, or tools purchased on behalf of the customer are also non-cancellable. This 
          is because third-party providers often have their own non-refundable policies, and Justvy Global Innovations 
          LLP must adhere to these terms.
        </p>
        <p>
         For example, if a client requests a specific software license for their project, and Justvy Global Innovations 
         LLP purchases it on their behalf, the cost of that license is non-cancellable and non-refundable, regardless 
         of the project’s outcome.
        </p>

        <h1 className="font-bold text-4xl py-3">Refunds</h1>
        <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl">Reference to Refund Policy</h3>
        <p>
          For detailed information on refunds, clients should refer to our <a href="/policies/refund-policy" className="text-blue-600">Refund Policy</a>. The Refund Policy outlines 
          the conditions under which refunds may be issued, the process for requesting a refund, and any associated 
          timelines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clients are encouraged to review the Refund Policy before initiating a cancellation request to fully 
          understand their rights and obligations.
        </p>
