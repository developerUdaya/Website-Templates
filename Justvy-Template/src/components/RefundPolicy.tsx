          At Justvy Global Innovations LLP, our top priority is the satisfaction of our clients. We understand that, despite our best 
          efforts to deliver quality IT products and services, there may be circumstances where a refund request is warranted. This Refund 
          Policy is designed to clearly outline the conditions and processes under which refunds may be issued, particularly for our IT 
          products and services, including but not limited to payment gateway integration, software development, cloud solutions, and more.
        </p>

        <h1 className="font-bold text-4xl py-3">Eligibility for Refunds</h1>
        <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl">Overview</h3>
        <p>
          Refunds at Justvy Global Innovations LLP are not issued lightly, and we make every effort to resolve issues to our clients' satisfaction 
          before considering a refund. However, we recognize that there are specific situations where a refund may be the appropriate course of 
          action. This section outlines the criteria for refund eligibility to ensure fairness and transparency in our business dealings.
        </p>
        <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl">Service or Product Specification Non-Compliance</h3>
        <p>
          One of the primary criteria for refund eligibility is when the service or product delivered does not meet the specifications agreed 
          upon in the project contract or the defined scope of work. For instance, if a client has contracted us to develop a specific software 
          application with particular functionalities, and the final product deviates significantly from these agreed-upon functionalities, 
          a refund may be warranted.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, it is important to note that minor deviations or changes that were approved during the development process may not qualify 
          for a refund. The determination of whether the delivered service or product meets the agreed-upon specifications will be based on 
          documented communication, project contracts, and mutual agreements.
        </p>
        <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl">Unresolvable Technical Issues</h3>
        <p>
          At Justvy Global Innovations LLP, we pride ourselves on providing robust and reliable IT solutions. However, in the rare event that 
          a technical issue arises and persists beyond our control, we will make every effort to resolve it within a reasonable timeframe. 
          Should we be unable to resolve the issue within 15 business days after receiving a formal request from the client, the client may 
          be eligible for a refund.
        </p>
        <p>
          This clause applies to issues that significantly impair the functionality of the product or service, rendering it unusable or severely 
          limiting its intended use. Our team will thoroughly investigate and document all efforts made to resolve the issue before approving a refund.
        </p>
        <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl">Duplicate or Incorrect Transactions</h3>
        <p>
          In some cases, customers may inadvertently make duplicate payments or incorrect transactions. Justvy Global Innovations LLP is committed 
          to addressing these situations promptly. If a client identifies a duplicate payment or an incorrect transaction, they should notify 
          us immediately. Upon verification, we will process a refund for the duplicate or incorrect amount without delay.
        </p>

        <h1 className="font-bold text-4xl py-3">Non-Refundable Items</h1>
        <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl">Fully Delivered and Accepted Products or Services</h3>
        <p>
          Once a product or service has been fully delivered and accepted by the client, it is generally considered non-refundable. Acceptance is 
          usually documented through written confirmation, acceptance of deliverables, or any other form of acknowledgment from the client.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if a client has commissioned a website and has provided written approval of the final site, the service is considered 
          fully delivered and accepted. Any requests for refunds after this point will not be entertained, as the service has been completed 
          to the client's satisfaction.
        </p>
        <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl">Milestone-Based Custom Software Development</h3>
        <p>
          In the case of custom software development projects, work is often divided into milestones. Each milestone represents a significant 
          phase in the development process, such as design, coding, testing, or deployment. Once a milestone is completed and approved by the 
          client, it becomes non-refundable.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, if a client has approved the design phase of a software project, they cannot request a refund for that phase after 
          approval, even if they later decide to cancel the project. This policy ensures that our team is compensated for the work completed 
          at each stage of the project.
        </p>
        <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl">Third-Party Costs</h3>
        <p>
          Occasionally, projects may require the procurement of third-party services, software, or licenses on behalf of the client. Any costs 
          incurred for these third-party services are non-refundable. For example, if a client requests a specific software license or cloud 
          service as part of their project, and we purchase it on their behalf, the cost of that software or service is non-refundable, 
          regardless of the outcome of the project.
        </p>
        <p>
          This policy is in place because third-party providers often have their own non-refundable policies, and Justvy Global Innovations 
          LLP must adhere to these terms.
        </p>

        <h1 className="font-bold text-4xl py-3">Refund Request Process</h1>
        <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl">Initiating a Refund Request</h3>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl">Required Information</h3>
        <p>
          When submitting a refund request, clients should provide the following information to help us process the request:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">

              <strong>Order or Project Reference Number:</strong> This is a unique identifier for the transaction or project in question. 
              It allows our team to quickly locate and review the relevant details.

              <strong>Reason for the Refund Request:</strong> A clear and concise explanation of why the client believes a refund is warranted. 
              This should include any relevant details about how the product or service did not meet expectations or specifications.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Supporting Documentation or Screenshots:</strong> Any evidence that supports the refund request, such as screenshots 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl">Submission and Acknowledgment</h3>
        <p>
          Once a refund request is submitted, our support team will acknowledge receipt within 3 business days. This acknowledgment will 
          include a reference number for the request and an estimated timeframe for review.
        </p>
        
        <h1 className="font-bold text-4xl py-3">Assessment and Approval</h1>
        <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl">Review Process</h3>
        <p>
          All refund requests undergo a thorough review by our technical team. This process includes:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
            <li>
              <strong>Verification of the Client's Claims:</strong> Our team will review all relevant project documentation, communication, 
              and deliverables to determine whether the client's claims are valid.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Investigation of Technical Issues:</strong> If the refund request is related to a technical issue, our technical team 
              will attempt to replicate the issue and assess the efforts made to resolve it.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Assessment of Third-Party Involvement:</strong> If third-party services, software, or licenses are involved, we will 
              review the terms of those services to determine refund eligibility. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl">Decision and Notification</h3>
        <p>
          The review process typically takes 10 business days from the date of submission. Once a decision is made, the client will be 
          notified via email. If the refund is approved, we will provide details on the amount to be refunded and the method of refund.
        </p>
        <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl">Processing Timeframe</h3>
        <p>
          Approved refunds are processed within 7 business days through the original payment method. Clients should be aware that it may 
          take additional time for the refund to reflect in their account, depending on their bank or payment provider.
        </p>

        <h1 className="font-bold text-4xl py-3">Partial Refunds</h1>
        <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl">Criteria for Partial Refunds</h3>
        <p>
          In some cases, a partial refund may be more appropriate than a full refund. Partial refunds may be issued under the following 
          circumstances:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
            <li>
              <strong>Partial Service Delivery:</strong> If only a portion of the service has been delivered and accepted, the client may 
              be eligible for a refund of the remaining balance.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Minor Issues:</strong>  If the service or product has minor issues that do not significantly impact its functionality 
              or use, a partial refund may be offered as compensation.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl">Determination of Refund Amount</h3>
        <p>
          The amount of the partial refund will be determined based on the percentage of work completed, the impact of any issues, and the 
          costs incurred by Justvy Global Innovations LLP.
        </p>
