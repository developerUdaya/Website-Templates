            <strong>Credit/Debit Cards:</strong> We accept all major credit and debit cards, including Visa, MasterCard, and American 
            Express. Card payments are processed securely through our payment gateway provider, ensuring that your financial information

        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Bank Transfers:</strong> Clients may choose to pay via direct bank transfer. Bank transfer details will be provided upon 
            request or during the invoicing process. Please note that bank transfers may take a few days to clear, and services will only 
            commence once the payment has been confirmed.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Digital Wallets:</strong> For clients who prefer digital payments, we accept payments through popular digital wallets 
            such as PayPal, Google Pay, and other similar services. These methods offer a quick and convenient way to complete your transaction.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>UPI (Unified Payments Interface):</strong> For clients based in India, we accept payments through UPI, a real-time payment 
            system that facilitates inter-bank transactions. This method is both fast and efficient, often completing within seconds.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Other Payment Gateways:</strong> Depending on the client's location or preference, we may accept payments through additional 
            payment gateways as specified during the transaction. Any specific payment gateway options will be communicated to the client in advance.
        </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl">Security Measures</h3>
        <p>
          Justvy Global Innovations LLP prioritizes the security of our clients' payment information. We use industry-standard encryption 
          and secure payment gateways to process all transactions. Clients can be assured that their financial data is handled with the 
          utmost care and is never stored on our servers without consent.
        </p>

        <h1 className="font-bold text-4xl py-3">Payment Terms</h1>
        <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl">Project-Based Services</h3>
        <p>
          For project-based services, the following payment terms apply:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
        <li>
            <strong>Upfront Payment:</strong> A minimum of 50% of the total project cost is required upfront before any work commences. 
            This advance payment secures your project's place in our schedule and covers initial costs, including planning, design, and 
            any preliminary development work.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Final Payment:</strong> The remaining balance is due upon completion of the project and prior to the final delivery 
            of deliverables. Clients will receive a final invoice detailing the work completed and any additional charges incurred (if applicable). 
            Full payment must be received before the final product is handed over or deployed.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Milestone Payments:</strong> In some cases, where projects are particularly large or complex, payment may be broken 
            down into milestones. Each milestone will represent a specific phase of the project (e.g., design, development, testing), and 
            payment will be required upon the completion of each milestone. This approach ensures that both parties remain aligned throughout 
            the project's duration.
        </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl">Subscription-Based Services</h3>
        <p>
          For clients utilizing our subscription-based services, the following payment terms apply:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
        <li>
            <strong>Advance Payments:</strong> Payments for subscription-based services must be made in advance, according to the billing cycle 
            selected (monthly, quarterly, or annual). Clients will receive an invoice or payment reminder before the start of each billing period.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Automatic Renewal:</strong> Unless otherwise specified, subscriptions will automatically renew at the end of each billing 
            cycle. Clients are responsible for ensuring that payment details are up-to-date to avoid service interruptions.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Suspension of Service:</strong> Failure to renew a subscription before the due date may result in the suspension or 
            termination of the service. If a service is suspended due to non-payment, it will only be reactivated once full payment of 
            any outstanding balance is received.
        </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl">Custom Payment Plans</h3>
        <p>
          In some cases, Justvy Global Innovations LLP may offer custom payment plans tailored to the specific needs of a client or project. 
          These plans will be detailed in the project contract or service agreement and must be adhered to throughout the duration of the 
          project or service period.
        </p>
        
        <h1 className="font-bold text-4xl py-3">Invoices</h1>
        <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl">Invoice Issuance</h3>
        <p>
          Invoices for services rendered by Justvy Global Innovations LLP are issued electronically and sent to the customerâ€™s registered 
          email address. This ensures that clients have immediate access to their billing information and can process payments promptly.
        </p>
        <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl">Invoice Details</h3>
        <p>
          Each invoice will include the following details:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
        <li>
            <strong>Invoice Number:</strong> PA unique identifier for tracking and reference purposes.
        </li>

        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl">Payment Deadline</h3>
        <p>
          Unless otherwise agreed upon in the contract, invoices must be paid within 15 business days from the date of issuance. This timeframe 
          allows clients sufficient time to process payments while ensuring that Justvy Global Innovations LLP receives timely compensation for 
          the services provided.
        </p>

        <h1 className="font-bold text-4xl py-3">Late Payments</h1>
        <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl">Late Payment Fees</h3>
        <p>
          Invoices that are not paid within the specified timeframe are subject to a late payment fee of 2% per month on the outstanding balance. 
          This fee is applied to cover the administrative costs associated with managing overdue accounts and to encourage prompt payment.
        </p>
        <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl">Service Suspension</h3>
        <p>
          Continuous delays in payment may result in the suspension of services until all outstanding payments are received. If services are 
          suspended due to non-payment, Justvy Global Innovations LLP reserves the right to charge a reactivation fee to cover the costs 
          associated with resuming services.
        </p>
        <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl">Debt Collection</h3>
        <p>
          In cases where invoices remain unpaid for an extended period, Justvy Global Innovations LLP may engage third-party debt collection 
          agencies to recover the outstanding balance. Clients will be responsible for any additional fees incurred as a result of debt 
          collection efforts.
        </p>
        
        <h1 className="font-bold text-4xl py-3">Payment Disputes</h1>

        <p>

          addressed promptly, minimizing disruption to services.
        </p>

          once this payment is received.
        </p>

          invoiced amount, regardless of currency fluctuations.
        </p>

        <h1 className="font-bold text-4xl py-3">Third-Party Fees</h1>
        <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl">Responsibility for Fees</h3>
        <p>
